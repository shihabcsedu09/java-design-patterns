# Java Design Patterns

This repository contains example implementations of classic design patterns in Java. Each pattern is organized in its own folder, with well-documented code, JavaDocs, and a dedicated README (including diagrams and usage examples) to help you learn and understand each pattern.

## Implemented Patterns

### Creational Patterns
- [Factory Method](src/main/java/creational/factory/README.md)
- [Singleton](src/main/java/creational/singleton/README.md)
- [Abstract Factory](src/main/java/creational/abstractfactory/README.md)
- [Builder](src/main/java/creational/builder/README.md)
- [Prototype](src/main/java/creational/prototype/README.md)

### Structural Patterns
- [Decorator](src/main/java/structural/decorator/README.md)
- [Adapter](src/main/java/structural/adapter/README.md)
- [Bridge](src/main/java/structural/bridge/README.md)
- [Composite](src/main/java/structural/composite/README.md)
- [Facade](src/main/java/structural/facade/README.md)
- [Flyweight](src/main/java/structural/flyweight/README.md)
- [Proxy](src/main/java/structural/proxy/README.md)

### Behavioral Patterns
- [Chain of Responsibility](src/main/java/behavioral/chainofresponsibility/README.md)

## How to Use
- Browse each pattern's folder for code and documentation.
- Each pattern's README explains the pattern, its implementation, and provides a class diagram and example usage.

## Contributing
Feel free to open issues or pull requests to add more patterns or improve documentation.

Happy learning!
