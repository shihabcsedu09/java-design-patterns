# Java Design Patterns

This repository contains example implementations of classic design patterns in Java. Each pattern is organized in its own folder, with well-documented code, JavaDocs, and a dedicated README (including diagrams and usage examples) to help you learn and understand each pattern.

## Implemented Patterns

### Creational Patterns
- [Factory Method](src/main/java/creational/factory/README.md)
- [Singleton](src/main/java/creational/singleton/README.md)
- [Abstract Factory](src/main/java/creational/abstractfactory/README.md)

### Structural Patterns
- [Decorator](src/main/java/structural/decorator/README.md)

## How to Use
- Browse each pattern's folder for code and documentation.
- Each pattern's README explains the pattern, its implementation, and provides a class diagram and example usage.

## Contributing
Feel free to open issues or pull requests to add more patterns or improve documentation.

Happy learning!
